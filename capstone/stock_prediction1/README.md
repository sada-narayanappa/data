# Stock Price Prediction

## Background

In this project, I have created a notebook to download the current stock prices. You do not need to use the notebook - you can just use the historic data that is here for your class project. 

The goals here is to find a relevant set of news data from the internet and for midterm, you can provide a sketch of the solution to predict the stock price end of the day. 
You are welcome to find resources to get the hourly or 10 minutes stock prices and use that data as well.

Next, for term project, use the news data you downloaded in the previous step and create predictive analytics (I encourage you to explore LSTM networks) to predict the price.

You may use [Tutorial on LSTM Link](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-lstm-models-for-time-series-forecasting/) to learn about LSTM.
