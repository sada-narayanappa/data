# Facial Recognition

Facial Recognition has been a very hot topic since early 2000s. While most people are similar with Facial Recognition through their phone recognizing them or Facebook and Google auto tagging themselves and their friends and family in photos uploaded to the service, facial recognition has been growing in law enforcement. We have truly gone from TV shows and movies depicting computers matching individuals as science fiction to this technology being used on a daily basis at multiple agencies in government. 

## Background and question
How is it possible for a computer to understand and then classify and identify faces in photographs? Once the computer can identify what a face is, it can then train and learn known persons faces to then identify unknown persons. The computer will be trained on these unknown persons and then be scored based on how accurately it can identify images of persons who are both included and excluded from the known persons. 

## Data 

[Data](https://github.com/sada-narayanappa/COMP4449/blob/master/capstone/facial_recognition/FRImages.zip
)

The dataset used in this project was generated using images collected of TV and Movie actors along with a handful of known persons close to this project. The dataset contains 554 images. These images vary in size and quality and are all stored in RGB color. These images are stored as images in many image formats, such as .jpg and .png formats. These images will also be labeled based on the person or persons contained within the image itself.
