### Data - *[Download](https://github.com/emmanueliarussi/DataScienceCapstone/tree/master/7_FinalProjects/ReturntoKronos/data/task1.zip)*

In addition to the static sensor data, the data includes lectures from a mobile sensor known as *Rosie the Robot*. Rosie was a mail-delivering robot that traversed the entire building twice a day. Employees only knew her as a mail delivery system, but the GAStech management had installed an on-board prox card reader, so that she recorded prox cards that appeared within 5 meters of the reader. Data from Rosie, combined with other data, allowed contestants to hypothesize the insider threat employee, as well as how and when inappropriate activities were occurring.  The following data was provided for this task:

* A building layout for the GAStech offices, including the maps of the prox zones and the HVAC zones
* A current list of employees, roles, and office assignments
* A description of the data formats and fields provided
* Proximity sensor data for each of the prox zone regions
* Proximity sensor data from Rosie the mobile robot
* HVAC sensor readings and status information from each of the buildingâ€™s HVAC zones
* *Hazium* readings from four sensors (hazium is a fictitious chemical that has become a recent concern on the island of Kronos. Not much is known about its effects, but it is suspected that Hazium is not good for people).
