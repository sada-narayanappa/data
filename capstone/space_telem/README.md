# Satellite Telemetry Analysis 

Telemanom employs vanilla LSTMs using Keras/Tensorflow to identify anomalies in multivariate sensor data. 

In this CAPSTONE project, you will review the paper and the implementation in https://github.com/khundman/telemanom

For mid-term, you will provide a report of understand the contents.

For term-project, you will extend the implmentation to include transformers or attention mechanism to improve the accuracy of the result
