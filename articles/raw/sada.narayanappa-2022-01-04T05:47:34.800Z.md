# Binomial trees in option pricingâ€£

In the binomial option pricing model, the underlying security at one time period, represented as a node with a given price, is assumed to traverse to two other nodes in the next time step, representing an up state and a down state. Since options are derivatives of the underlying asset, the binomial pricing model tracks the underlying conditions on a discrete-time basis. Binomial option pricing can be used to value European options, American options, as well as Bermudan options.

The initial value of the root node is the spot price S0 of the underlying security with a risk-neutral probability of increase q, and a risk-neutral probability of loss 1-q, at the next time step. Based on these probabilities, the expected values of the security are calculated for each state of price increase or decrease for every time step. The terminal nodes represent every value of the expected security prices for every combination of up states and down states. We can then calculate the value of the option at every node, traverse the tree by risk-neutral expectations, and after discounting from the forward interest rates, we can derive the value of the call or put option.
