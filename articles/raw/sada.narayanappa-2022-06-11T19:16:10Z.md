# Recommendation Technology for Digital Engineering Artifacts
‣
OBJECTIVE: Develop innovative recommendation algorithms applicable to digital data engineering artifacts and tools that could be used by system engineers for the Missile Defense System (MDS) Systems of Systems (SoS) to support identification and classification of authoritative sources of truth (ASoT) throughout system development life cycles.

 

DESCRIPTION: This topic seeks new and innovative technologies for applying a user-personalized content recommendation engine for collaborative filtering based on the user’s reviews and comments, sentiment analysis, and ratings for artifacts and tools throughout the Systems Engineering (SE) V process applied to new artifacts and tools.  Existing recommendation engines (e.g. crowdsourcing techniques) were developed for large scale commercial applications that draw upon millions of users with billions of inquiries on common topics to establish preferred relationships.  Government engineers would number in the hundreds, and would make tens of thousands of inquiries on specialized technical engineering, data, and Modeling and Simulation (M&S) artifacts, many unique to the Government.  These artifacts generally would be associated with Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) artifacts providing significant direct correlation data.  However, preferred relationships will change as systems progress through their development cycles and include additional artifacts and data such as engineering analysis, test data, M&S data, RAM data, production and fielding data.

Often, products and data are developed at each level of the V-model, then passed on to the next level in a stove piped fashion and are not treated as a strategic asset that exists across the entire lifecycle.  Thus, these products are usually not reusable or extensible for other aspects of engineering.  Additionally, knowledge learned throughout this process is difficult to capture and reinsert into the next round of activities by the people that are developing and using the next round of artifacts and tools.

With the complexity of the MDS increasing and the amount of data exponentially increasing, faster and smarter engineering techniques and tools that are based on collaborative development of pipelines that work in automatic ways while enabling a user content recommendation engine are desired.  In addition, technologies that allow one to query across all the collected and metadata tagged engineering data sets are also desired.  Lastly, technologies that enhance the quality and effectiveness of the MDS, shorten integration time enabling the government to gain efficiencies reducing schedules, and produce more lethal weapon systems are also of interest.

 

PHASE I: Design and develop improved solutions, methods, and concepts for applying user-personalized content recommendation engines and crowdsourcing in systems engineering to create and rate sources of truth and knowledge across the MDS SoS.  The solutions should capture the key areas where new development is needed, suggest appropriate methods and technologies to minimize the time intensive processes, and incorporate new technologies researched during design development.  Define the architecture and data structures for the MDS M&S enterprise.

 

PHASE II: Complete a detailed prototype design user-personalized content recommendation engine and a crowd sourced environment incorporating government performance requirements. The contractor should coordinate with the government during prototype design and development to ensure that the delivered products will be relevant to ongoing and planned missile defense projects.  This prototype design will be used to form the development and implementation of a mature, full-scale capability in Phase III.

 

PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Scale-up the capability from the prototype utilizing the new hardware and/or software technologies developed in Phase II into a mature, fieldable capability.  Work with missile defense integrators to integrate the technology for a missile defense system level engineering environment.
