**Introduction**

LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a high-sensitivity technique used in engineering, road planning, flood plain mapping, and other applications that demand more exact position data. LiDAR is capable of providing far more information than virtually any other method. LiDAR has altered the world of surveying and mapping. Since the early 1980s, hydrographic LiDAR has been an useful material testing method. LiDAR has made significant progress in providing precise details of complicated research endeavors. This strategy has the potential to overcome some of the previous methods' drawbacks (Arnold et al., 2006). A rising number of terrestrial unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or "drones") and airborne scanning systems (González-Jorge et al., 2017) are drawing a broader group of experts to employ such systems to support significant engineering and monitoring projects. Infrastructure of all types, from bridges to city structures and valleys, is examined in great depth (Wang et al., 2013; Roca et al., 2016). In the future, the lidar will play a critical role. While there are several potential for the development of new lidar technologies, lidar operations are still in the early stages of development.

**Principle of LIDAR:** 

LiDAR (light detection and ranging) is a remote sensing technique that may be used in the air. It sends light pulses to the target and gets diffused light and visual reflection in return. A laser scanner, a GPS receiver, and an inertial measurement unit are the three main components of the system (Webster and Dias, 2006; Pfeifer and Briese, 2007). By multiplying the speed of light over a period of time, the distance (range) between the LiDAR sensor and the object may be computed. The width accuracy can be as high as 2-3 cm (Lemmens, 2007). The flight track is recorded using a GPS receiver, and the flight is measured using an IMU device. The return of several laser pulses can be recorded by some LiDAR aerial systems. When a laser pulse hits a target that does not entirely block the beam, the leftover portion passes to the lower item, causing several reversals. Multiple retrieval recording is quite useful for mapping a location in a wooded region. or a description of the forest's nature and structure (Sheng et al., 2003). The discrete return system is another name for the LiDAR in the air discussed earlier. Before the next release, most LiDAR aerial systems can only capture one laser pulse reflection. A platform called multi-pulse technology was created to boost the data entry rate of the flying flight. This method enables for the simultaneous recovery of numerous laser pulses (Pfeifer and Briese, 2007). Multiple scanners can also be put in a single air location to improve the side or front and back axles.

**Internal problems with turkney atmospheric LIDAR system to support application:** 

Supporting LIDAR r applications, converting research LIDAR to turnkey systems, and lowering costs are all efforts that must be taken. Industrial laser advancements have enhanced the LIDAR system's dependability and decreased system development and running expenses during the last 20 years. Aerosol and water vapour measurements are now accessible on micropulse-type LIDAR (Welton et al., 2001). Compact Raman LIDAR’s have been demonstrated to function in both the air and the ground (Wu et al., 2016). However, we still have a long way to go to solve many of the issues. One of the most successful LIDAR systems for aerosol and cloud monitoring is micropulse LIDAR. It's critical to improve the near-face measurements (within 500 metres) of a ground-based system architecture. Near-surface aerosol readings, water vapour, and temperature are often undetected or very ambiguous due to the inadequate overlap between the optical transmission and reception systems. These intimate facial measurements, on the other hand, are critical for many operating systems. Future LIDAR systems will increase our air monitoring capabilities by adding a ceilometer and boosting power (Engelmann et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016).

**LIDAR system of ocean rates:**

Oceans are poorly managed and control global climate and climate change. Ocean viewing from orbit through microwave and infrared reveals more than simply the ocean's surface. For decades, underwater structures have been studied using airborne LIDAR’s (Hoge and Swift, 1981). At least from aerial platforms, improved LIDAR estimates for Brillouin dispersion, Raman dispersion, and fluorescence signals can offer simultaneous information on seawater mixing temperatures, high salts, and other chemical component information (de Lima Ribeiro et al. 2019).

**Statistics of the plants and state:**

Many spectral LIDAR systems are predicted to fill a major vacuum in earth science by combining two crucial factors: the 3D geometry of the earth's objectives and the sort of visual space that may be used with spectral information. In sketching the cover of an urban environment, Morsy et al., (2017) found that combining building height and spectral information yielded much greater precision than the data alone. Bathymetry rehabilitation utilising a single spectral channel is a well-established LIDAR method, but there is still room for innovation, such as employing mono-spectral LIDAR and invisible spectral pictures to map water on the shore (Zhang et al., 2019). Many lidars combine multiple water absorption and latitude values to better precisely map coastal waters and land/water borders (Morsy et al., 2018)

**Processes biospheric, cryosphere, and hydrologic:**

The data required to capture biospheric, cryosphere, and hydrologic processes are progressively being provided by a variety of beams and scanning systems. The need for detailed 3D measurements of terrestrial plants in space and time is critical, yet resources are scarce. Clouds created by imaging lidars can be used to eliminate morphometric-related characteristics from water (see e.g. Koenders at al., 2014). GLAS' data from ICESat-1 has aided in the extraordinary development in understanding mountain ice captions in relation to climate change.

Accurate water quality estimations provide unique worldwide knowledge regarding water conservation and flow, bridging a significant gap in the water cycle on the planet. Because LIDAR estimations of atmospheric water levels are restricted in both location and time, new methods for successfully communicating such information are required (Phan et al., 2012).

**Area of the city and environment:**

 The generation of 3D models of urban space is now a standard scanning system for LIDAR systems (Pu and Vosselman, 2009; Vosselman and Maas, 2010), but there is a clear trend toward accurate representation of ever-growing data within a built structure - space, such as individual trees and symbols. (Wang et al., 2017). The issue here is technical flexibility in terms of downsizing and autonomous data processing, as well as concurrent creation of algorithms and their underpinnings. The majority of people reside in cities and suburbs. The influence of urban climate and air quality on the structure of the PBL, as well as how urban structures alter the structure of the PBL, remains an unanswered question (National Research Council, 2012). To enhance urban climate and climate forecasting, numerous scientific, technical, and mathematical problems remain. It is critical to comprehend the architecture and dynamics of urban PBLs. Although there are several methods for providing near vision, they are insufficient for identifying and evaluating the physiological mechanisms that cause urban PBL (Muller et al., 2013). The top 90% of the urban boundaries is still unregulated. Regional LIDAR networks with multifunctional LIDAR systems can help fill the data gap in urban PBL research and enhance forecasting in urban areas.
 
**Summary:**

Future LIDAR uses may go beyond the aforementioned typical sectors. Independent vehicle development requirements are driving the rapid evolution of short-range 2-D / 3-D LIDAR. Other enhancements to the all-fiber LIDAR might make it more dependable and cost-effective to detect turbulence, wind shear, volcanicash, colder clouds with a greater danger of breaking, and high ice clouds in water from aeroplanes in real time, allowing for safer flight performance. (Thobois et al., 2019; Schmitt, 2017). Lidar measurements from land, aircraft, and satellite will continue to revolutionise our capacity to assist worldwide scientific research and the power of new LIDAR applications if we effectively fulfil these obstacles.
