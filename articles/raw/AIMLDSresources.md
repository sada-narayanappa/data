These are some recommended and good quality classes you may consider in your learning plan.â€£

* **Coursera Machine Learning** :
https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
This is a fundamental class every data scientist should master. The drawback of this course is that it emphasizes on Octave rather than Python. one may have to translate the examples into python and work through the examples.

* **Statistical Learning**:
 https://online.stanford.edu/courses/sohs-ystatslearning-statistical-learning
This is a wonderful statistical analysis training. It uses the [freebook](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/). I highly recommended to purchase or print the free book to work along the class.The course emphasizes on R programming Language. It would be great to translate the examples to python or just learn the principles using R


* **Deep Learning**:

This is a highly recommended advanced series of 4 classes. This is a great set of intense courses to break into AI.Deep Learning is one of the most highly sought after skills in tech. This class will help you become good at Deep Learning.
