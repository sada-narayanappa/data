#### How to conduct strategic planning

---
 
** Strategy**  defines the long-term direction for the enterprise by describing what success looks like and what needs to be done to achieve that success.

** Strategic plans ** cover the midterm horizon and describe how the strategy will be executed by identifying the roadmap of initiatives necessary to deliver the strategy.

** Operations/Tactics ** plans and defines the projects, programs and products that are required in the short term to deliver the initiatives identified in the strategic plans.
The strategic planning process must cover all three horizons as they serve different purposes.
 
The words “strategy” and “strategic plan,” are often used interchangeably.

#### Strategy Sets the Long-Term Direction
Strategy defines the long-term strategic ambition and focus of the enterprise. It defines what the enterprise will do to compete and succeed in its chosen markets or, for the public sector, it describes what the enterprise will do to successfully fulfill its mission. 

The strategy horizon typically covers a period of three to five years. However, this may be longer for certain sectors or industries.

#### Strategic Plans Define How Strategy Will be Realized Over the Midterm

Strategic plans describe how the enterprise will realize its long-term ambitions. They identify the roadmap of initiatives and portfolio of investments that will be required to achieve the objectives defined in the strategy.
Strategic plans will be created for the key business domains such as I&T, people, marketing and supply chain. For I&T, the strategic plan will define the target architecture needed to deliver the strategic actions defined in the strategy, and the required target operating model. It will also identify the roadmap of initiatives and investments that will be required to reach those targets and execute the strategy.
Strategic plans typically cover a period of 12 to 24 months.


#### Operational Plans Cover the Short-Term Execution
Operational plans identify the projects, programs and products that are required to deliver the initiatives identified in the strategic plans. Hence, they are focused on the execution of the changes required to realize the enterprise’s strategic ambition. Operational plans are usually closely related to the enterprise’s budget process and are not, therefore, typically affected by the same confusion as strategy and strategic plans.
Operational plans normally cover a period of six to 12 months.
The Strategic Planning Process Must Cover Strategy, Strategic Plans and Operational Plans
A strategic plan lacks the longer-term outlook and is therefore not a substitute for, or a variant of, the strategy, and a strategy without a supporting strategic plan is not sufficient to drive execution. In order to create a foundation for success, the strategic planning process should therefore cover both strategy and strategic plans — as well as operational plans.


The lack of clear distinction between strategy and strategic plans often leads to one of two situations:

> CIOs and their teams set out to create a strategy, but end up producing long documents that include detailed planning elements. These CIOs then become frustrated when their documents don’t get read or used, or when the documents fail to produce the desired value or business outcomes. At the same time, including detailed plans in the overall strategy may quickly give the strategy a “dated” feel — even though the overall strategic direction remains valid. This approach may also result in the whole strategy document being subject to additional approval cycles when only the planning content has been changed.

> CIOs create a high-level strategy that lacks enough actionable content to drive execution — for example, by including a list of goals with no explanation of how those goals will be achieved or how success will be measured. These CIOs then struggle to manage demand for new projects, to prioritize the projects in their portfolios, and to communicate the strategic alignment of their budgets and detailed project plans.
To address this challenge, CIOs must structure their strategic planning across three separate horizons (see Figure 1).

The three strategic planning horizons are the strategy that sets the long-term direction, strategic plans that describe how the strategy will be realized over the midterm and operational plans that cover short-term execution.

The three planning horizons are closely related and sequentially interdependent. But they also create distinct and separate artifacts with each serving a different purpose and created for a different audience. It is important, therefore, to avoid mixing or combining the outputs of each horizon in a single document.

To be effective, strategic planning must create a clear connection across the three horizons from the strategic actions defined in the strategy, through the strategic initiatives contained in the strategic plans, down to the individual activities in the operational plans.
