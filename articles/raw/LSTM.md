# Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Models in Deep Neural Networks

Long Short-Term Memory networks, or LSTMs for short, can be applied to time series forecasting.

There are many types of LSTM models that can be used for each specific type of time series forecasting problem.

In this tutorial, you will discover how to develop a suite of LSTM models for a range of standard time series forecasting problems.

>The objective of this tutorial is to provide standalone examples of each model on each type of time series problem as a template that you can copy and adapt for your specific time series forecasting problem.


After completing this tutorial, you will know:
